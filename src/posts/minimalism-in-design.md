# The Art of Minimalism in Web Design

Minimalism isn't about removing everything until you're left with nothing. It's about removing everything until you're left with everything that matters.

## The Core Principles

**White space is not empty space.** It's breathing room for your content. It gives your words and images the space they need to be heard and seen.

**Typography matters more than you think.** The right font can make or break the reading experience. Cardo, for instance, was designed specifically for book typographyâ€”it's built for long-form reading.

**Color should serve a purpose.** Every color choice should have intention. That red-orange link color? It draws attention to interactive elements without overwhelming the content.

## Why This Matters

In a world of infinite scroll and constant distraction, a minimal website is an act of rebellion. It says: "Here, focus on this. Just this."

The best websites don't try to do everything. They do one thing exceptionally well.

*What do you think? Is there beauty in the bare essentials?*
