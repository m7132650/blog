# Why Typography Matters More Than You Think

Good typography is invisible. Bad typography is everywhere.

## The Reading Experience

When you choose a font, you're not just picking lettersâ€”you're shaping how people experience your words. The right typeface can make text feel warm and inviting. The wrong one can make it feel cold and distant.

**Cardo**, the font used throughout this site, was designed specifically for book typography. It's built for long-form reading, with subtle details that make text comfortable to read for extended periods.

## The Details That Matter

- **Line height**: Too tight, and text feels cramped. Too loose, and it feels disconnected.
- **Letter spacing**: The space between letters affects readability and mood.
- **Font weight**: Bold text should feel confident, not aggressive.

## The Web's Typography Revolution

We're living in a golden age of web typography. With services like Google Fonts and variable fonts, we have access to beautiful typefaces that were once reserved for print.

But with great power comes great responsibility. Just because you *can* use a dozen different fonts doesn't mean you *should*.

*Sometimes the best design choice is restraint.*
