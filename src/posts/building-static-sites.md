# Why I Chose Static Site Generation

Static sites are having a moment, and for good reason. They're fast, secure, and surprisingly powerful.

## The Speed Factor

When your site is just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, there's no database to query, no server-side processing to wait for. Pages load instantly.

**Performance isn't just about user experienceâ€”it's about respect.** Respect for your readers' time, their data plans, their attention.

## The Simplicity

No complex build processes. No database migrations. No server maintenance. Just files that work.

This blog is built with Eleventy, but the principles apply to any static site generator:

- Write in Markdown
- Generate HTML
- Deploy anywhere

## The Reliability

Static sites don't go down. There's no database to crash, no server to overload. Just files sitting on a CDN, ready to be served.

*Sometimes the old ways are the best ways.*
